### Why do Rails 7 Form Helpers accept the parameters they do?

Have you ever wondered how `form_with` helpers function?

How is it possible that they can infer a) how to handle building a path, and b) whether the path should be to create a new instance or update an existing instance?

TL;DR: if an object defines behavior from `ActiveModel::Model` on its own instances, or delegates the `persisted?` and `to_model` messages to an instance that has `ActiveModel::Model` behavior defined on itself, the `form_with` method is able to correctly extrapolate the resource name, action, and if appropriate, resource ID.

This can be particularly useful if you are leveraging the Form Object Pattern to build complex forms that either don't map directly to a single resource/route or that you work like to coerce to map to a particular resources routes.

### The Deep Dive

The secret lies in 2 clever instance methods that are defined in `ActiveModel::Model` and leveraged by the [`polymorphic_path` method](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/polymorphic_routes.rb#L126):

- `persisted?`
- `to_model`

For the purposes of this exercise, let's build up the contract required for the polymorphic_path from a PORO (Plain Old Ruby Object). Imagine we have a `Person` class:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end
end

# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `to_model' for #<Person:0x000000011707ec58 @id=1>

```

If we pass an instance of the `Profile` class to `polymorphic_path`, the method first checks to see whether the record can be converted to a model by calling...`to_model`. Let's give our class the ability to respond to that message:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end

  def to_model
    self
  end
end

# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `model_name' for #<Person:0x0000000117327860 @id=1>
```

As a model, the routes helper expects that our `Person` class will also be able to respond to the `model_name` message with an object an object that responds to `name`:

```ruby
ModelName = Struct.new(:name)
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end

  def to_model
    self
  end

  def model_name
    ModelName.new('Person')
  end
end

# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `persisted?' for #<Person:0x00000001173958d8 @id=1>
```

Next, the polymorphic_path checks to see whether the object is `persisted?`. When `persisted?`, the `polymorphic_path` method attempts to construct a path for the `edit` action. Otherwise, it attempts to construct a path for the `create` action.

Let's see how adding a `persisted?` method changes the behavior:

```ruby
ModelName = Struct.new(:name)
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end

  def to_model
    self
  end

  def model_name
    ModelName.new('Person')
  end

  def persisted?
    false
  end
end

# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `route_key' for #<struct ModelName name="person">
```

Seems like `polymorphic_path` is expecting model_name to also respond to `:route_key`, which would be the pluralized version of the class name:

```ruby
ModelName = Struct.new(:name, :route_key)
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end

  def to_model
    self
  end

  def model_name
    ModelName.new('Person', 'people')
  end

  def persisted?
    false
  end
end

# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `people_path'
```

Success! At this point, polymorphic_path has generated a path that, if defined in our routes file, would map to a controller action!
What happens if our model is `persisted?`? In that case, `polymorphic_path` expects that `model_name` will respond to a `singular_route_key` call:

```ruby
ModelName = Struct.new(:name, :route_key, :singular_route_key)
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end

  def to_model
    self
  end

  def model_name
    ModelName.new('Person', 'people', 'person')
  end

  def persisted?
    true
  end
end

# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `person_path'
```

Pretty close! The only outstanding detail to confirm is that the polymorphic_path is correctly populating the correct ID (i.e. `1`) for our instance. After updating the `routes.rb` with `resources :person`, we see our `person_path` is populated with the ruby object's ID in memory, rather than the ID stored in the instance variable.

To remedy this, we need to override our PORO's definition of `to_param`:

```ruby
ModelName = Struct.new(:name, :route_key, :singular_route_key)
class Person
  def initialize(id)
    @id = id
  end

  def to_model
    self
  end

  def model_name
    ModelName.new('Person', 'people', 'person')
  end

  def persisted?
    true
  end

  def to_param
    @id.to_s
  end
end
# rails console
p = Person.new(1)
app.polymorphic_path(p)
# => "/person/1"
```

SUCCESS! While building up the API of messages a PORO must respond to is a good exercise to better understand the inner workings of an API we might take for granted, it's impractical to worry about defining these methods on every object.

Thankfully, we are able to `include ActiveModel::Model` in our PORO to gain access to these methods, or we can choose to `delegate :persisted?, :to_model` to another model.
