# Ariel Fogel's Blog

> Software engineering insights on Rails development, AI security, and learning sciences from a researcher and practitioner. Covers practical tutorials, security research, and educational methodologies with a focus on Ruby on Rails, LLM safety, and evidence-based learning approaches.

This blog represents the intersection of practical software engineering and academic research. Content ranges from hands-on Rails tutorials to cutting-edge AI security research, including prompt injection analysis and LLM safety considerations. The author brings both industry experience (founding engineer at Pillar Security) and academic background (Masters in Learning Sciences from UW-Madison).
